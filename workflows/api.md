description: Describe the API contract for a cloud-based project
---

Evaluate the API contract of this project from the perspective of a senior software architect. Does it have a well defined API with a clean separation of concerns between the frontend(s) and backend? If not, what are the gaps? The goal is to get to a well defined API, because we want to support multiple front-end clients (web, iOS & Android apps), and we will need an API source of truth to ensure they are all able to talk to each other as they are developed in parallel.
