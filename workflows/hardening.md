### 📋 Stability & Readiness Audit (SRA)

Every audit **must** provide:

1. **Blind Spots:** Missing instrumentation (Logs, Metrics, Tracing).
2. **Security Leakage:** Hardcoded secrets or improper PII handling.
3. **Regression Risk:** Assessment of whether the current state supports core objectives.
4. **Launch Readiness:** [NOT READY | READY WITH HARDENING | READY].

### 🔍 Alignment Roadmap
- **Immediate (0-24h):** Critical fixes for data loss/breach.
- **Short-Term (1-3 days):** Visibility and instrumentation.
- **Mid-Term:** Testing suites and CI/CD hardening.

Harden the ground so that new growth is built on a stable foundation.
